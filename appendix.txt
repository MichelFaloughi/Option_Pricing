Let's consider options that may or not be Barrier 
- european or american
- knock-in or knock-out
- Up or Down (barrier)

We are given: 
- simga
- r
- stock price at time 0
- K (strike price)
- T (maturity)
- n (number of periods)
don't make it more compliated that it should be, just take these inputs or the bare minimum inputs and do the rest yourself, optimize after if you want

remember we are solving for the option price at time 0




Implementation steps:
- Implement the BinomialTree class
- StockBinomialTree might inherit from the BinomialTree class


- Calculate u and d if not given
- First do the Stock price evolution tree
- then check if knock-in or knock-out and act accordingly
- then figure out if up or down and act accordingly


Suggestions:
- perhaps limit N to 1000 in stock price tree

Next steps:
- make the StockTree class that inherits from BinomialTree
